       <h1>Coxsbazar</h1>
       <p>After Bangladesh's independence, Cox's Bazar started to receive administrative attention. In 1972 the town committee of
    Cox's Bazar was once again turned into a municipality. In 1975, The Government of Bangladesh established a pilot plant
    at Kalatali.[6] In 1984, Cox's Bazar subdivision was promoted to a district, and five years later (in 1989) the Cox's
    Bazar municipality was elevated to B-grade.[4] In 1994 (jobs) the Marine Fisheries and Technology Station (MFTS) was
    established at Cox's Bazar. MFTS is a research station of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) headquartered
    in Mymensingh. The station covers a land area of four hectares and contains five laboratories.</p>

       <h1>Saint martin</h1>
       <p>The only way to reach St. Martin's Island is by water transportation: boats and ships (mostly for tourists) from Cox
    Bazar and Teknaf. The only internal transport for island is non motorized van (pulled by man.) The roads are made of
    concrete, and their condition are decent. All the hotels run generators until 11 PM which are not allowed afterwards, so
    they then rely on solar power, which is popular throughout the island. There is no electricity supply from the national
    grid since a hurricane in 1991. During the day, it comes alive with water and beach sports, with beach parties and
    bonfires.</p>
